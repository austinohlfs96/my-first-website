    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>Hi I'm Austin Ohlfs! 
      I am from the great state of Colorado! For the past eight years I have been working as a ski and bike tech in Vail Colorado. I love spending time outside in the mountains hinking, camping, golfing, and floating the rivers in the summertime, and you especially riding my snowboard in the winter! When im not spending time in the mountains I enjoy going to concerts and sports events. I like to see musician who is good live, and I root for all my Denver sports teams win or lose! I am excited about this new chapter in my life learning sofewar development. I can't wait to be able to implement the skills to create programs and solve real problems!</p>
